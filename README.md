- Description <br>

Movie Preference Analyzer is a simple interactive web application that allows users to discover their favorite movie category based on their choices. <br>

The user is presented with two columns of movies. From these, the user selects a total of five movies. Based on these selections, the system analyzes the choices and determines the user’s preferred movie category (for example: Action, Comedy, Drama, Horror, etc.). <br>
